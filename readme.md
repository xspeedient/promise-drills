## Promise Drills

These 4 short exercises are standalone examples of using promises. Instructions for each drill can be found in the javascript files themselves. Before you get started remember to:

```
npm install
```

You will probably need to use:

* [Promise documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
* [Spotify API documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/)
* [Node Request Package documentation](https://github.com/request/request)

There are no tests, so you will have to determine if you're code is working. You can run each script (except `00-promisifyRequest.js`) using node as follows:

```
node 01-singlePromise.js asheru
node 02-chaning.js asheru
node 03-all.js
```

There are helpful examples that can be found here: https://github.com/gSchool/spotify-promises-example

### Double Plus Bonus:

* Complete this stretch exercise (or "The Original" linked from here) to make an express server that supports these kinds of requests: https://github.com/gSchool/spotify-albums-and-tracks-server-side-remix

The Original uses JQuery and front end requests, the remix uses an express server!
